# Full stack open

This repository is structured with branches. E.g.

```sh
part-0
part-1
    course-info
    unicafe
```

You can use `git branch` to list the branches or GUI like GitHub's. The branches are also listed below for convenience.
When you want to develop backend and frontend at the same time use [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).

> [!NOTE]
> pnpm was used to install dependencies, but using it not strictly necessary and npm ought to work as well.
> If you wish to use pnpm run `corepack enable` followed by `corepack use pnpm@9.2.0` for best results. [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) is installed by default on recent Node.js versions.
