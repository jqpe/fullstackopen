# Full stack open

This repository is structured with branches. E.g.

```sh
part-0
part-1
    course-info

```

You can use `git branch` to list the branches or GUI like GitHub's.

> [!NOTE]
> Some branches might specify `pnpm` as package manager, this is not strictly necessary and npm ought to work as well.
